# Why don't apps match brains?
**draft**
I am afraid that this article is in progress. I will probably regret putting it out there in its current form.

#### Brains: pretty highly evolved
Your brain is a network of connections that evolved to model things and events well enough that the body the brain is in can find food and make more bodies with brains. Brains seem to model the world they inhabit with their brain structure. Different parts of the brain specialize but are connected profusely. Most of all, to our conscious selves, all this results in one single, coherent representation. The match between brain and the outside world is so perfect that we can make sense of and act in the world pretty effortlessly without thinking about it.

Speaking strictly for myself, that is. I assume that this is true for a lot of people, but that might be impossible to be totally sure about. (see bibliography)

#### Computers: not so much

So, we have separate apps, or databases, or web services for contacts and to-do items, notes, tasks, whatever. If we have a name for it ("Grocery List", "Recipe Box!", "Calendar", "Address book!", "Journal"), then it certainly deserves it's own app!

This separate database approach is a problem, and it is why these things aren't that useful or long lasting. However fancy our to do list system is, it still can't model the real world so it just becomes a huge pain in the ass.

A really useful 'app' would be one that effortlessly extends the capability of our brains. 

Making fancy to-do list apps is a great way to make some money however, because everyone will buy one at some point in their life when they feel like they're losing control. This is a great thing to take advantage of if you write software and want to make some money.

there are plenty of other examples - to go to extremes, we also separate tabular data and documents into different apps, then make a huge deal out of our ability to embed a spreadsheet into a text document. Or, at least, Microsoft still does this. Nobody else is that impressed. Contacts data is separate from everything else. Notes you take on an article go _somewhere_, maybe Notability. Everything else including how we solved that last ad-blocker issue, is in email somewhere, or maybe confluence, or (god forbid) jira, or slack, or was that in our github pages? Wait, did i just write that down in my notebook?

Every one of these apps makes the fundameental mistake of assuming that it's ok to represent a part of the world in an isolated place. To their credit, it woudl be way too scarey for any CTO to purchase an app that was where you are going to put everything. I mean, what if that wasn't backed up? What if it uses some proprietary form of markdown?

#### A proposal for how computers ought to work
So, since your brain doesn't have a separate place for storing lists of things to do but rather has stuff like that in context of the things it uses, or affects, or people it requires, or documentation that would apply to getting the job done. It may have learnings where you would like to write down "here's how I figured out how to take apart the grill without destroying it" or want to know 'When did I install Ruby 2.7?'

I'm pretty sure i spend a lot of my time trying to fine where a thing is. We just accept that that is the way things are, and that there is no better way, and we are always going to be limited, slow, forgetful human beings because we have really crappy tools. We can send a person to the moon but we still use email. 
So this is the proposal. ...watch this space...
